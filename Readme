# Face Detection Model Comparison

A comprehensive analysis and comparison of two face detection models: Caffe SSD and YuNet.

## Project Overview

This project evaluates and compares the performance of two modern face detection models using benchmark and stress test videos.

## Key Features

- Model comparison between Caffe SSD and YuNet
- Performance testing on standard and stress conditions
- FPS and detection count analysis
- Confidence score analysis
- Visual failure analysis

## Results Summary

### Benchmark Video
- Caffe SSD: 11.77 FPS, 804 detections
- YuNet: 6.56 FPS, 875 detections

### Stress Test Video
- Caffe SSD: 12.69 FPS, 0 detections
- YuNet: 6.69 FPS, 270 detections

## Key Findings

- YuNet shows superior detection capabilities
- 8.8% more detections in benchmark conditions
- Significantly better performance in challenging scenarios
- More consistent confidence scores

## Usage

1. Test model loading:
```bash
python scripts/test_models.py
```

2. Run detection comparison:
```bash
python scripts/run_detection.py
```

3. Analyze confidence scores:
```bash
python scripts/confidence_analysis.py
```

## Conclusion

YuNet is recommended for production use with a confidence threshold of 0.40, offering better reliability and consistent detection across varying conditions.
