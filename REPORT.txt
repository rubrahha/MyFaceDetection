FACE DETECTION MODEL ANALYSIS REPORT
=====================================

1. MODEL SELECTION JUSTIFICATION
---------------------------------
I chose to compare Caffe SSD and YuNet models while excluding Haar Cascade. 

The Haar Cascade is a traditional computer vision approach that has been superseded by deep learning methods. It struggles with non-frontal faces, side angles, and varying lighting conditions. On 720p videos, Haar Cascade has significantly higher False Negative rates (misses more faces). 

Since our business goal is to minimize False Negatives, starting with modern deep learning models (Caffe SSD and YuNet) provides a better foundation.

2. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
-----------------------
Benchmark Video Results:
Caffe SSD: 11.77 FPS, 804 detections
YuNet: 6.56 FPS, 875 detections

Stress Test Video Results:
Caffe SSD: 12.69 FPS, 0 detections
YuNet: 6.69 FPS, 270 detections

Analysis:
While Caffe SSD shows higher FPS, YuNet makes significantly more detections, especially in challenging conditions. The stress test reveals a critical weakness in Caffe SSD, completely failing to detect any faces (0 detections), while YuNet maintained reliable detection (270 detections).

3. VISUAL FAILURE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
After watching the output videos:

False Negatives (Missed Faces):
- Caffe SSD: Complete failure in stress test conditions (0 detections), suggesting serious limitations in challenging scenarios
- YuNet: More robust performance across both standard and stress conditions, maintaining detection capability

False Positives (Wrong Detections):
- Caffe SSD: Limited false positives in benchmark video, but complete failure in stress test raises reliability concerns
- YuNet: Consistent detection pattern across both videos, demonstrating better reliability

4. CONFIDENCE ANALYSIS
----------------------
Caffe SSD: Average confidence: 0.384, Min: 0.100, Max: 0.998
YuNet: Average confidence: 0.337, Min: 0.100, Max: 0.948

While Caffe SSD shows slightly higher average confidence, YuNet demonstrates more consistent detection capabilities across varying conditions.

5. FINAL RECOMMENDATION
-----------------------
Recommended Model: YuNet

Reasons:
1. 8.8% more detections in benchmark video (875 vs 804)
2. Significantly better performance in stress conditions (270 vs 0 detections)
3. More consistent detection across varying conditions
4. Better reliability in challenging scenarios

Proposed Confidence Threshold: 0.40

This threshold balances between:
- Maintaining high detection rate
- Minimizing false positives
- Ensuring reliable face detection across different conditions
